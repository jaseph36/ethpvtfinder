# Ethpvtfinder
A tool to find Ethereum private keys from verified messages in Etherscan


It will derive Ethereum address from private key, check for all tokens under that address, complete a balance check for each token, then display ptivatekey, address, and token info (balance, price, value in USD) on screen, as well as output to file.
